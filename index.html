						Education in India
					</p>
					<p class="secSub_tag text_small">
						Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India's
						constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a
						'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
						responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now
						with 28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between
						states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast.
						Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of
						state-level programs and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the
						majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary
						schools is growing.

						Open and distance learning

					<p class="secSub_tag text_small">
						At the school level, Board of Open Schooling and Skill Education, Sikkim (BOSSE), National
						Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) provides opportunities for continuing education to those who
						missed completing school education. 1.4 million students are enrolled at the secondary and
						higher secondary level through open and distance learning.[133] In 2012 various state
						governments also introduced "State Open School" to provide distance education.[134]

						At higher education level, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) co-ordinates distance
						learning. It has a cumulative enrolment of about 1.5 million, serviced through 53 regional
						centres and 1,400 study centres with 25,000 counselors. The Distance Education Council (DEC), an
						authority of IGNOU is co-coordinating 13 State Open Universities and 119 institutions of
						correspondence courses in conventional universities.

						Online education
					</p>
					<p class="secSub_tag text_small">
						Online learning involves courses offered by primary institutions that are 100% virtual. Online
						learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses
						taken in a brick-and-mortar school building. It is a development in distance education that
						expanded in the 1990s with the spread of the commercial Internet and the World Wide Web. The
						learner experience is typically asynchronous but may also incorporate synchronous elements. The
						vast majority of institutions utilize a learning management system for the administration of
						online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support
						learning and pedagogy continue to transform as well.
